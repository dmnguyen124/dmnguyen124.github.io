# Demi Nguyen's Portfolio

Hi! I'm Demi, a freshman computer science student @ CSUF, though actually I recently declared a double major in art.  

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs
Lab 7
In this lab, we used if-statements to see when someone would be able to park. I liked how this lab felt practical and not as abstract as the previous ones, when we were more limited in what we could code. It felt like solving a riddle trying to figure out how to implement the parking signs into conditional logic. Plus, that was the second time Eliana and I worked together, so it was pretty chill.

Lab 8, part 2
This lab included a nested for-loop. I liked this lab because Diego was a great partner, and we were able to cooperate really smoothly to finish pushing all of the code before the lab period ended. In particular, it was really satisfying to run the command ./pattern and see the cute little pattern appear on our first try.

Lab 10
This lab involved reading data from a file. I thought it was interesting because it revisited the states function from before, but this time we were able to implement it differently because of something new that we learned. Something that I remember from this lab is that we spent a stupidly long time trying to look for what was causing a logic error while debugging, only to have an "Oh, duh!" moment because it was a simple mistake. Imanol and I were able to laugh it off, and we finished pushing the code right as the class was over.
